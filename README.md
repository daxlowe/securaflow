# Manual

## React Frontend
The React frontend is bootstrapped using Vite.

### Setup For Local Dev
1. Make sure you have Node installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the `client` directory.
3. Run `npm install`. This looks at the package.json file and installs any of the required packages that are not already present.
4. Run `npm run dev`. This runs the frontend with the files as they are on your machine. When you edit the code and run this, you will see your changes.

### Building
1. Running `npm run build` will build and pack your current local version of the application.
2. Running `npm run preview` allows you to see the the current built version of the application.
